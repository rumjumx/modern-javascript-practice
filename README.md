## 🧠 Repository Contents

This repository is organized to reflect the course structure while keeping the `main` branch clean:

- `README.md` – Overview and instructions
- `LICENSE` – The Unlicense
- `boilerplate/` – Starter files for exercises (ignored in `main`)
- Individual chapters branches, e.g., `01-variable-data-types`, etc.

> ⚠️ Note: All code here is **my personal practice and notes**, not the course’s copyrighted material.

---

## ✅ Purpose

- Practice modern JavaScript concepts
- Build a well-organized archive for reference
- Showcase learning progress safely in public

---

## 📚 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rumjumx/modern-javascript-practice.git
```

2. **Switch to a lesson branch**

```bash
git checkout 01-variable-data-types
```

3. **Explore and run exercises**
   Modify code freely to experiment and learn.

4. **Return to `main` when done**

```bash
git checkout main
```

---

## 🔀 Branch Strategy

- `main` – Contains only `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and boilerplate files
- Lesson branches – Each lesson/folder has its own branch (e.g., `01-variable-data-types`)
- `backup-all-lessons` – Optional full backup of all exercises

This keeps `main` clean while allowing modular exploration.
